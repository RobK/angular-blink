Angular-blink
=============

Undoing the travesty that was the removal of **&lt;blink>**, thanks to AngularJS it's back! No longer do we have to suffer the injustice and indignity imposed upon us by so called "standards". Once again **&lt;blink>** can reclaim its rightful place.

Other solutions (such as [blink-polyfill](https://github.com/wearefractal/blink-polyfill)) provide CSS code that only approximate the original, this solution operates 
exactly like the original **&lt;blink>** element, in that only text blocks blinked, not inline elements (like &lt;img>'s)  - I mean, we don't want to effect usability now do we?
It works cross browser (including IE). It degrades [relatively] gracefully when Javascript is not available.
